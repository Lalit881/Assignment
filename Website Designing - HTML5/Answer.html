    <div>
      <h3>Q.1 &#41; What are the new tags added in HTML5?</h3>
      <p>
        &lt;article&gt; : Represents a self-contained piece of content that can
        be independently distributed or reused, such as blog posts, articles,
        and forum posts.<br />
        &lt;section&gt; : Defines a thematic grouping within a document. It's
        often used to group related content together.<br />
        &lt;nav&gt;: Signifies a section of the page that contains navigation
        links, such as menus or table of contents.<br />
        &lt;header&gt;: Represents the introductory content of a section or
        page. It usually contains headings, logos, and navigation elements.<br />
        &lt;footer&gt;: Represents the closing content of a section or page,
        often containing copyright information, author details, and links to
        related content.<br />
        &lt;aside&gt;: Used for content that is related to the main content but
        can be considered separate from it, like sidebars, pull quotes, or
        advertisements.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>Q.2 &#41; How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</h3>
      <p>
        1. Save your audio and video files in a new directory on your
        computer.<br />
        2. Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called index.html.<br />
        3. Add &lt;audio> and &lt;video> elements to the page; make them display
        the default browser controls.<br />
        4. Give both of them &lt;source> elements so that browsers will find the
        audio format they support best and load it. These should include type
        attributes.<br />
        5. Give the &lt;video> element a poster that will be displayed before
        the video starts to be played. Have fun creating your own poster
        graphic.<br />

      <p>
        &lt;article&gt; : Represents a self-contained piece of content that can
        be independently distributed or reused, such as blog posts, articles,
        and forum posts.<br />

      <h3>Q.4 &#41; Canvas and SVG tags?</h3>
      <h3>canvas</h3>
      <p>
        1. The &lt;canvas> element provides a drawing surface through
        JavaScript. It allows for the creation of dynamic, bitmap-based
        graphics.<br />
        2. Canvas requires scripting (usually JavaScript) to draw shapes,
        images, and other graphical elements.<br />
        3. It is essentially a blank slate, and you use JavaScript to draw on
        it.<br />
        4. Canvas is well-suited for applications that require real-time
        rendering, such as games or interactive data visualization.<br />
        5. Graphics drawn on a canvas are not retained as objects; once drawn,
        they are pixels on a bitmap and can't be individually manipulated.<br />
        6. Canvas graphics are resolution-dependent, meaning they can appear
        pixelated on high-resolution displays.<br />
        Example
        <canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="200"></canvas>
        <script>
          const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
          const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
          ctx.fillStyle = "red";
          ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);
        </script>
      </p>
      <h3>SVG</h3>
      <p>
        1. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format 
          that allows for the creation of resolution-independent graphics.<br>
        2. SVG is more like a document structure, similar to HTML, 
          and uses XML tags to define shapes, paths, and other graphical elements.<br>
        3. It's easy to manipulate and animate SVG elements using CSS or JavaScript.<br>
          Graphics in SVG are retained as objects, which means 
        4. they can be manipulated individually (e.g., scaling, rotating).<br>
        5. SVG graphics are resolution-independent and scale perfectly on all devices and screen sizes.<br>
        <svg width="100" height="100">
            <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="blue" />
        </svg>
      </p>
